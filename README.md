# Cypress-tests

In this repository you will find my Cypress test cases that I wrote during course.

> Status: Ongoing ðŸ”„

## Pre-requirements

It is required to have git, Node.js and npm installed to clone and run this project.

> I used versions `2.39.3`, `v16.16.0`, and `8.11.0` of git, Node.js and npm, respectively. I suggest you use the same
> or later LTS versions.

## Installation

Run `npm install` (or `npm i` for the short version) to install the dev dependencies.

## Tests

Run `npm test` (or `npm t` for the short version) to run the tests in headless mode.

Or, run `npm run cy:open` to open the Cypress App and run the tests in interactive mode.

### "Mouse Action" test

In this test, I use the drag-and-drop plugin.

You can find more information about this plugin here: [drag-and-drop](https://github.com/4teamwork/cypress-drag-drop)

### "Hover over" test

Another great plugin for using hovers over feature is "cypress-real-events"
